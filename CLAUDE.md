## Git Workflow (CRITICAL)

**Always follow this workflow before making ANY file changes:**
1. Run `git pull origin main` to get the latest code
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/description`
3. Make changes and commit
4. Push branch and create PR - never push directly to main
5. Do NOT run `vercel --prod` - Vercel auto-deploys on merge

This prevents overwriting changes that were merged via GitHub.

## Copy/Content Policy

**Never edit website copy without permission.** Before making any changes to text content (paragraphs, headings, testimonials, FAQ answers, descriptions, etc.):
1. Show the exact change you intend to make (before and after)
2. Ask for explicit permission before making the edit
3. Only proceed after receiving approval

This applies to all content on the site - always preserve the original copy from breathewitheli.com unless explicitly asked to change it.
