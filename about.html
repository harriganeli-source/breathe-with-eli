                    <p>Eli Harrigan is a certified breathwork practitioner, somatic coach, and group facilitator. His approach weaves together a range of modalities—including inquiry, parts work, shadow work, bioenergetics, and other somatic practices—and is shaped by ongoing mentorship with senior practitioners and guides, including Jesse Torgerson, who has been facilitating emotional healing around the world for over 40 years.</p>
                    <p>Eli brings a unique blend of analytical clarity and creative intuition to his work. With a background in Western philosophy, video production, and photography, it wasn't until Eli discovered somatics that he realized he had been living his life primarily inside his head, and that there was another, much more rewarding way of being. This work has been revolutionary in his personal and professional life, and he is passionate about sharing it with others.</p>
                    <p>Today, Eli leads regular men's groups, workshops, and private sessions for people ready to reconnect with their bodies, untangle long-held patterns, and step into a freer, more fully expressed way of being.</p>
                    <p>Whether working one-on-one or with a group, Eli creates a space that is clear, intuitive, and unpretentious—where presence, emotion, and truth are welcome.</p>

                <p style="color: var(--color-text-light);">There are many types of breathwork for somatic release such as Stanislav Grof's Holotropic Breathwork and Leonard Orr's Rebirthing Breathwork. Dynamic Breathwork, developed by my teacher Jesse Torgerson, follows in these traditions, but combines the conscious connected breath with a system of somatic points used to locate and dissolve emotional and physical armoring that has outlived its usefulness. The points allow the material to come into consciousness, and the breath allows it to be metabolized.</p>
